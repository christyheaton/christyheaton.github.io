I initially heard about Data Umbrella while scanning throught the PyLadies Slack. Data Umbrella is a group for under-represented persons in data science. They offer remote educational webinars on relevant data science topics in a welcoming environment.

Back in Slack, the webinar being advertised must have caught my eye because I've been attending ever since! After watching a few talks and scanning through subjects that had already been presented, I offered to give a talk about geospatial data analysis and was accepted!

Coordinating with the Data Umbrella team was a pleasure and I had great fun putting my presentation together. Check out the recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXHG-bLGT0Y&t=3029s).

Have a look at the [Data Umbrella Website](https://www.dataumbrella.org/) to learn more about past and future activities with this exceptional group!
