I really enjoyed PyConUS 2018 in Cleveland, OH. Here are some highlights:

* I gave a tutorial on Spatial Analysis and Maps with Python. I had a great time putting the whole thing together, and it went well! I liked that I presented right at the beginning of the conference, so that I didn’t have to stress about it most of the time. Check out the recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRvTeK5Ndq8&t=829s).

* After my tutorial a few of my students approached me and turned out to be Esri employees. I got a chance to talk to them about what their software can do as it relates to Jupyter Notebooks which is super exciting.

* I met the creator of Python, Guido van Rossum! He was attending the conference just like anybody else, and kindly took a picture with me. I also ended up sitting next to him at one of the plenary sessions. Note: I’m not short, he’s just really really tall.

* On more than one occasion I’d be sitting at breakfast/lunch or at a talk that was about to begin and someone would sit next to me who I recognized from the larger Python community. Everyone was really friendly and accessible, and I made some great new contacts.
* I had a little time to explore Cleveland, where I’d never been before.

* There was a 5k fun run event that got cancelled due to thunder and lightning. But a few of us went for a run that morning, sticking close to the venue.
