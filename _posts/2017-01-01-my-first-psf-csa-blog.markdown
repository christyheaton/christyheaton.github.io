My first Community Service Award post for the Python Software Foundation blog is on Shannon Turner. You can read the full post [here](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/01/i-use-python-to-help-build-kind-of.html).

After this post I ended up meeting her in person at PyCon 2018, and she was an absolute delight.
