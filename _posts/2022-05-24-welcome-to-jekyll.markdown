After watching a Data Umbrella webinar on how to [Create a Free Data Blog with Jekyll & GitHub Pages by Lauren Burke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SBXl94xNl8&t=2702s), I decided to make my own.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to create your own website with Jekyll.
