I'm participating in the [#30DayMapChallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) this year. Many of the maps are interactive! If you can click on the image it will redirect you to the interactive version. Note that if the map was made with PyScript, the page could take ~30 seconds to load.

### Day 1: Points

Populated places that have "cat" in the name.

### Day 3: Polygons

A country guesser game! Every time you refresh the page, a new mystery country will be shown. Take a (mental) guess and then hover over the area to see if you were right.
