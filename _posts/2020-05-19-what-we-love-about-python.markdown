Planning activities is a challenge in this time of uncertainty, but PyLadies Seattle pulled it together for this panel discussion on What We Love About Python. I had the pleasure of facilitating the discussion which included panelists Guido van Rossum, Emily Spahn, Thea Flowers, and Reshama Shaikh. 

Topics discussed were:

* What are the top Python-powered COVID-19 projects you’ve seen?
* What’s your favorite Python thing you’ve tinkered with during quarantine?
* What’s your favorite “hack” to help keep you productive during quarantine?
* What is your favorite Python package?
* What has been your experience with the Python community? Any particular successes or challenges?
* What do you think are the most interesting changes made to Python in the last few years?
* What do you love about Python?

It was a great discussion!
