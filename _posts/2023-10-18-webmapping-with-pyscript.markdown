PyScript allows you to run Python code in a browser, much like JavaScript! It even sets up a virtual environment for you which will eliminate a lot of pain points when getting started with Python.

For my first web map using PyScript, I made a map of 5 random hikes in the State of Washington, based on data from the Washington Trails Association. [Check it out](https://cheaton.pyscriptapps.com/5-random-hikes-in-washington-state/latest/)!
