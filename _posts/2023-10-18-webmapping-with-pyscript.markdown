I just started using [PyScript](https://pyscript.net/) and it's awesome!

PyScript allows you to run Python code in a browser, like JavaScript does, so you don't have to worry about having a local Python setup. It even creates a virtual environment with configurable libraries, which will eliminate a lot of pain points when getting started with Python.

After making a few apps tinkering around, I decided to make a few visualizations in PyScript.

I've been doing data analysis and visualizations with matplotlib in Jupyter Notebooks for a while, so I decided to start with a chart. I have a few friends who I play [Qwirkle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qwirkle) with, one of whom usually wins. I digitized one of our rounds and put it in a plot. Looks like b was ahead the whole time, as usual. [Have a look](https://cheaton.pyscriptapps.com/qwirkle-scores/latest/).

For my first web map using PyScript, I made a map of 5 random hikes in the State of Washington, based on data from the [Washington Trails Association](https://www.wta.org/). There are so many beautiful hikes to choose from, so making a map of just a few has been a fun way to check out hikes I may have missed otherwise. [Check it out](https://cheaton.pyscriptapps.com/5-random-hikes-in-washington-state/latest/)!

The best way to get started with PyScript is by creating an account on [pyscript.com](pyscript.com) and creating a new project, which is how I made the apps that have been linked in this post. 

I'll definitely keep using PyScript and look forward to seeing how the project evolves.
